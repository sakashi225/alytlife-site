title: "I Tried Doing Nothing Productive for 48 Hours — And Didn’t Explode"

I spent 48 hours doing nothing productive. No journaling, no meditation, no optimization. Just being.  

At first, it was hard. My brain kept looking for tasks. Slowly, the noise dulled. I noticed the little things: the hum of the fridge, laughter, morning light.  

I didn’t transform. But I felt more human. That’s enough.
